# Raspberry Pi 3 B

- Purchased in 2018 at AISVN and used to stream video over composite to 7" screen over composite
- Currently (2024-09) running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) in my laboratory
- It might work well with a 7" touch display, as [described in this post](https://piamble.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/home-assistant-energy-dashboard/)
