# Raspberry Pi 4 B

- Purchased in early 2020
- Overheating, in an enclosure with fan
- Should be used for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) in the future, it has similar spects to the [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/) and in connection with a 7" 1024x600 Touch display could work for input to the system and controlling the home
- The [Home Panel Addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-home-panel) has not been updated since 2023 and is read only since January 2024. Will it still work?
